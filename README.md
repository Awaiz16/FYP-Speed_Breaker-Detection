# FYP-Speed_Breaker-Detection
Detection of Road Bumps is a final year project aimed at developing a system to automatically detect road bumps and irregularities on roads to enhance vehicle safety and driving comfort. The project involves creating a sensor-based or camera-based detection system that identifies bumps in real-time and alerts the driver or records the data for analysis.


_METHODOLOGY:_
Deep learning model will be used to detect bumps.Driver will be alerted if a bump is detected. As the car passes over the
bump, the device records its location using IMU and GPS data, which is then added to a database. If the same bump is 
encountered again, the device will alert the driver from a greater distance, even if the deep learning model doesnâ€™t
detect it.



*MAIN GOAL:*
The main goal is to develop a reliable system that can detect road bumps and provide timely alerts to drivers, helping to prevent accidents and improve vehicle performance over uneven terrain.
